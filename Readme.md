# What is this?

This repo contains my solution of assignment in [2011 Stanford Machine Learning Class](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/).
HOWEVER, please DO NOT post any code before the due date according to "Stanford Honer Code" below.
Questions are always welcome, please drop me a mail. But please don't open any issues.


## Stanford Honor Code

"We strongly encourage students to form study groups, and discuss the lecture videos (including **in-video questions**). We also encourage you to get together with friends to watch the videos together as a group. However, the answers that you submit for the **review questions** should be your own work. For the **programming exercises**, you are welcome to discuss them with other students, discuss specific algorithms, properties of algorithms, etc.; we ask only that you not look at any source code written by a different student, nor show your solution code to other students."
